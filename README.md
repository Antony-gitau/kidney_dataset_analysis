The process i underwent when working on this model:

#preparing data for analysis and modelling
>> loading the data,
>> dropping unncessary columns,
>> extracting categorical and numerical data from the entire kidney dataset.
>> imputing errors in the data
>> analysing data using seaborn and plotly (EDA)
